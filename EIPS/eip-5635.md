## Abstract

This EIP standardizes an NFT licensing oracle to store (register) and retrieve (discover) granted licensing agreements for non-fungible token (NFT) derivative works, which are also NFTs but are created using properties of some other underlying NFTs.

The NFT owner, known as the `Licensor`, may authorize another creator, known as the `Licensee`, to create a derivative works (dNFTs), in exchange for an agreed payment, known as a `Royalty`. A licensing agreement outlines terms and conditions related to the deal between the licensor and licensee.

In this standard, there are four important roles as following,

- **oNFT**: An original underlying NFT. The holder of an oNFT is a licensor. An oNFT can be any NFT.
- **dNFT**: A derivative work based on one or more oNFTs. The holder of a dNFT is a licensee.
- **lNFT**: A licensing NFT which represents an licensing agreement. An INFT can be traded to a new Licensee in any NFT marketplace before its rights are exercised.
- **Registry**: A trusted smart contract able to certify the authenticity of the licensing agreement, where the most important role of Registry is to prove that the creator of the dNFT has indeed obtained the licensing agreement of the oNFT holder.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every [EIP-5635](./eip-5635.md) **lNFT** compliant contract MUST  implement the IERC5635,  [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)(or [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md)) and [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) interfaces.

    function argeementInputs(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
}
```

The Registry compliant contract MUST  implement IERC5635Registry and  [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) interfaces.

/**

interface IERC5635Registry {
    /**
     * @dev a license has been registered event.
     */
    event Register(address derivativeToken, address derivativeTokenId, address licenseToken, uint256 licenseTokenId);

    /**

     *
     * MUST revert if licenseToken is not support ERC5635 interface.
     * MUST revert if licenseTokenId is not exist.
     * MUST revert if derivativeToken is zero address.
     * MUST emit a `Register` event.
     */
    function register(address derivativeToken, address derivativeTokenId, address licenseToken, uint256 licenseTokenId)
        external;

    /**
     * @notice Check if a license has been registered for a given derivative.
     */
    function isRegistered(address derivativeToken, address derivativeTokenId, address licenseToken, uint256 licenseTokenId
    ) external returns (bool);

    /**
     * @notice Check if a license of origin(`originToken`+`originTokenId`) token
     *         has been registered for a given derivative.

    function isAuthorized(

        address derivativeTokenId,
        address originToken,
        uint256 originTokenId
    ) external returns (bool);
}
```

At the same time, we hope to have specially written license description contracts with legal effect.
This allows nft holders to issue legally recognized NFT licenses.

 */
interface IArgeement {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the license URI.
     * e.g https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode
     */
    function getLicenseURI() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the license name. e.g CC0-1.0
     */
    function getLicenseName() external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * @dev Allow verification of content to be written in legal code.
     * To reduce storage costs, each input MUST not exceed 32 bytes.
     */
    function checkInputs(bytes32[] calldata inputs) external view;
}
```

## Rationale

oNFT holder, as the licensor,can select the type of license agreement, fill in the contents
of the agreement, and mint license credentials. The license can be traded and circulated in
the market.

dNFT creators, as licensees,need to get licensor's authorization for dNFT. The licensee only
needs to buy a license from the marketplace or otherwise. Then choose a registration serveice
provider(`IERC5635Registry`) to register(call `register` method) the license with dNFT.

Eventually, anyone can check(call `isAuthorized` method) from the registration serveice
provider whether the oNFT licensor has authorized the dNFT.

If you wish to query for more details about the license, simply call the query method provided
by the license contract.

For example, anyone can retrieve licensing royalty information with `royaltyInfo` via the licensing token.
We encourage the NFT market to follow this EIP by issuing royalties to oNFT holders in real time
for dNFT transactions.

### Two stages: Licensing and Discovery

Taking the moment when the license is registered as the cut-off point, the stage before is called the
**Licensing** stage, and the subsequent stage is called the **Discovery** stage. The interface
`IERC5635` is for the **Licensing** stage, and the interfaces `IERC5635Registry` are for the
**Discovery** stage.

### Design decision: beneficiary of licensing agreement

As soon as someone sells their NFT, the full licensed rights are passed along to the new owner without
any encumbrances, so that the beneficiary should be the new NFT holder.

### Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md), [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md), and [EIP-2981](./eip-2981.md).

### Reference Implementation
